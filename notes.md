## TODO: Quests:
- **DONE** - pujcit knizku - podle medveda

## General problems:
- how to save a matrix - **vector/array**, int/floats?
- classes maybe? do they work in C++? if not then change for them to objective C?
- how to visualise them? grid/no grid?
- default field: real numbers, but what all fields do i want to create?
- program structure - as in arch.txt
- what ver. of Cpp i want to use?

## Arithmetics:
- addition,subtraction of 2 matrixes/numbers is simple enough
- MxM multiplication is harder - find out more on best
- inversion - gauss only way afaik - find out more
- determinant - no idea at all, even about how it works
- LUP-decomposition - no idea either
